# Inspect and Edit Parametric Schedules

## Description
This model will create arguments out of additional property inputs for parametric schedules in the model. You can use this just to inspect, or you can alter the inputs. It will not make parametric inputs for schedules that are not already setup as parametric. If you want to generate parametric schedules you can first run the Shift Hours of Operation Schedule with default 0 argument values for change in hours of operation.
